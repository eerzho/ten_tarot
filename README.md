# Project Setup Instructions

## Environment Setup

1. First, create a `.env` file in the project root directory using `.env.example` as a template. You can copy the contents of `.env.example` into `.env` and modify the variable values as needed.

## Building and Starting the Project

1. Run the following command to build the containers:

   ```bash
   make build
   ```

2. After the build is successful, start the containers with:

   ```bash
   make up
   ```

After completing these steps, your project should be ready to use.
